#. This is an image of the opening quotation character for your language.
#. The image is used as a watermark on blockquote elements. There are a
#. number of different quote characters used by various languages, so the
#. image name is translatable. The name of the icon should be of the form
#. "yelp-quote-XXXX.png", where XXXX is the Unicode code point of the
#. opening quote character. For example, some languages use the double
#. angle quotation mark. Translators for these languages should use
#. "yelp-quote-00AB.png". The image, however, is not automatically
#. created. Do not translate this to a value if there isn't a
#. corresponding file in yelp-xsl under the directory
#. icons/hicolor/48x48/status. Languages that use guillemets (angle
#. quotation marks) should use either 00AB or 00BB, depending on whether
#. the opening quotation is the left guillemet or the right guillemet.
#. Languages that use inverted comma quotation marks should use 201C,
#. 201D, or 201E. Single quotation marks don't make very nice watermarks,
#. so if you would normally open a quote with single quotation marks in
#. your language, use the corresponding double quotation mark for the
#. watermark image.

#. ID: biblioentry.label.format This is a format message used to format
#. the labels for entries in a bibliography. The content of the label is
#. often an abbreviation of the authors' names and the year of

#. but they are used in different places. The citation formatter is used
#. when referencing a bibliography entry in running prose. This formatter
#. is used for the actual bibliography entry. You may use the same
#. formatting for both, but you don't have to. Special elements in the
#. message will be replaced with the appropriate content, as follows:
