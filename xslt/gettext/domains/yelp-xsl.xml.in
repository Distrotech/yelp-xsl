<msg id="yelp-quote-201C.png">
<its:locNote>
This is an image of the opening quotation character for your language.
The image is used as a watermark on blockquote elements.  There are a
number of different quote characters used by various languages, so the
image name is translatable.  The name of the icon should be of the form
"yelp-quote-XXXX.png", where XXXX is the Unicode code point of the opening
quote character.  For example, some languages use the double angle quotation
mark.  Translators for these languages should use "yelp-quote-00AB.png".

The image, however, is not automatically created.  Do not translate
this to a value if there isn't a corresponding file in yelp-xsl under
the directory icons/hicolor/48x48/status.

Languages that use guillemets (angle quotation marks) should use either
00AB or 00BB, depending on whether the opening quotation is the left
guillemet or the right guillemet.  Languages that use inverted comma
quotation marks should use 201C, 201D, or 201E.  Single quotation marks
don't make very nice watermarks, so if you would normally open a quote
with single quotation marks in your language, use the corresponding
double quotation mark for the watermark image.

  comment.name - The name of the person making the comment
  comment.date - The date the comment was made

  These should be written as empty XML elements, e.g. <comment.name/>

  Additionally, format messages can use the i, b, and tt markup tags

  quote - An inline quotation
  http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/quote.html

  This is a format message used to format inline quotations.  This template
  uses roles to control how the quotation is formatted.  The role indicates
  whether this is an outer or inner quotation.  Quotations nested inside
  another quotation are inner quotations.  Many languages have an alternate
  notation for nested quotations.

  These stylesheets only provide two levels of quotation formatting.  If
  quote elements are nested deeper, the stylesheets will alternate between
  the 'outer' and 'inner' roles.  If your language uses different formatting
  for deeper quotations, please contact the maintainers, and we will try to
  implement a more flexible formatting mechanism.

  Special elements in the message will be replaced with the
  appropriate content, as follows:

  node - The text content of the quote element

  These should be written as empty XML elements.  Due to limitations
  in intltool, I can't write XML content in translator comments.  To

  right angle bracket.

  Additionally, format messages can use the i, b, and tt markup tags
