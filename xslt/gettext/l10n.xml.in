  This is an image of the opening quotation character for your language.
  The image is used as a watermark on blockquote elements.  There are a
  number of different quote characters used by various languages, so the
  image name is translatable.  The name of the icon should be of the form
  "yelp-quote-XXXX.png", where XXXX is the Unicode code point of the opening
  quote character.  For example, some languages use the double angle quotation
  mark.  Translators for these languages should use "yelp-quote-00AB.png".

  The image, however, is not automatically created.  Do not translate
  this to a value if there isn't a corresponding file in yelp-icons,
  under the directory icons/hicolor/48x48/status.

  Languages that use guillemets (angle quotation marks) should use either
  00AB or 00BB, depending on whether the opening quotation is the left
  guillemet or the right guillemet.  Languages that use inverted comma
  quotation marks should use 201C, 201D, or 201E.  Single quotation marks
  don't make very nice watermarks, so if you would normally open a quote
  with single quotation marks in your language, use the corresponding
  double quotation mark for the watermark image.

  glossseealso - A cross reference from one glossentry to another
  http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/glossseealso.html

  This is a format message used to format glossary cross references.
  This format message controls the sentence used to present the cross
  reference, not the link itself.  For the formatting of the actual
  link, see the message glossentry.xref.

  One or more glossseealso elements are presented as a links to the
  user in the glossary, formatted as a single prose sentence.  For
  example, if the user is being directed to the entries "foo", "bar",
  and "baz", the glossseealso may be formatted as "See also foo, bar,
  baz."

  Special elements in the message will be replaced with the
  appropriate content, as follows:

  glosssee - The actual link or links of the cross reference

  These should be written as empty XML elements.  Due to limitations
  in intltool, I can't write XML content in translator comments.  To
  insert the glosssee, simply write left angle bracket, glosssee,
  slash, right angle bracket.

  Additionally, format messages can use the i, b, and tt markup tags
  to mark text as italic, bold, and monospace.

  quote - An inline quotation
  http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/quote.html

  This is a format message used to format inline quotations.  This template
  uses roles to control how the quotation is formatted.  The role indicates
  whether this is an outer or inner quotation.  Quotations nested inside
  another quotation are inner quotations.  Many languages have an alternate
  notation for nested quotations.

  These stylesheets only provide two levels of quotation formatting.  If
  quote elements are nested deeper, the stylesheets will alternate between
  the 'outer' and 'inner' roles.  If your language uses different formatting
  for deeper quotations, please contact the maintainers, and we will try to
  implement a more flexible formatting mechanism.

  Special elements in the message will be replaced with the
